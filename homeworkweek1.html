<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 1: Understanding Hyperplanes</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>A hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of dimension one less than its ambient space. In the context of linear classification, a hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates data points into different classes. For example, in 2D, a hyperplane is a straight line, while in 3D, it is a flat plane.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 2: Hyperplane Equation</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>1. The equation of a hyperplane in 2D can be written as \(ax + by = c\).</p>
    <p>2. Yes, the equation represents a hyperplane in 3D. It's a plane represented by the equation \(ax + by - cz = 0\).</p>
    <p>3. A hyperplane can separate data points with different labels in 2D by acting as a decision boundary. Points on one side of the hyperplane belong to one class, and points on the other side belong to another class.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 3: Normal Vector</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
  <p><strong>Normal Vector in Hyperplanes:</strong> In the context of a hyperplane, a normal vector is like an arrow that stands straight up from the surface of the hyperplane. Imagine it as an arrow sticking out perpendicular to the flat decision boundary.</p>
    <p>Calculating the Normal Vector (2D): To find the normal vector of a hyperplane represented by the equation \(3x - 2y = 5\) in 2D, you can simply use the coefficients of \(x\) and \(y\). In this case, the normal vector is \([3, -2]\).</p>
    <p>Finding the Normal Vector from Two Points (2D): If you have two points on a hyperplane, like A: [1, 2] and B: [-1, -3], you can find the normal vector that points away from the plane. Here's how: First, calculate the direction vector between the two points, which is \([-2 - 1, -3 - 2] = [-3, -5]\). Then, to make it easier to work with, normalize this vector by dividing it by its length. So, the normalized normal vector would be \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{34}}[-3, -5]\).</p>
    <p>This way, you can think of the normal vector as an arrow that's perpendicular to the flat decision boundary of the hyperplane.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 4: Distance to Hyperplane</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>1. The distance from a point to a hyperplane is the shortest perpendicular distance between the point and the hyperplane. It measures how far the point is from the hyperplane's decision boundary.</p>
    <p>2. Calculate the distance from the point \(P(2, 3)\) to the hyperplane represented by the equation \(x + 2y = 7\) in 2D. First, find the equation of the line perpendicular to the hyperplane that passes through \(P\). Then, find the intersection point between the line and the hyperplane, and calculate the distance.</p>
    <p>3. The sign of the distance depends on which side of the hyperplane the point is located. If the point is on the same side as the normal vector, the distance is positive; otherwise, it's negative.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 5: Classification with Hyperplanes</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>1. Hyperplanes can be used for binary classification by serving as decision boundaries. Data points on one side of the hyperplane belong to one class, while points on the other side belong to a different class.</p>
    <p>2. To find a hyperplane that separates data into two classes, you can choose a normal vector and bias term in the hyperplane equation. The normal vector determines the orientation of the hyperplane, while the bias term shifts the hyperplane's position. By adjusting these parameters, you can find a hyperplane that correctly classifies the data.</p>
    <p>3. The normal vector and bias term play essential roles in the hyperplane equation. The normal vector determines the orientation, while the bias term shifts the hyperplane along the normal vector.</p>

  <p><strong>Exercise 6: Linear Separability</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Linear separability is a property of data points where they can be separated into distinct classes or categories using a single straight line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
  <p><strong>Exercise 7: Support Vectors</strong></p>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Support vectors are data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) in a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. These points are critical for defining the margin of separation.</p>

    <h1>Linear Algebra in Machine Learning</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Linear algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that plays a crucial role in various aspects of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms often involve large datasets and complex mathematical operations. Linear algebra provides the mathematical framework to represent and manipulate data efficiently. In this report, we will explore how linear algebra concepts, such as matrices and dot products, are applied in real-world machine learning scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Matrices in Data Representation:</h2>
    <p>Matrices are widely used in machine learning for data representation. In the context of image processing, each pixel in an image can be represented as a matrix element. For instance, a grayscale image can be represented as a 2D matrix where each element corresponds to the intensity of a pixel. In natural language processing (NLP), matrices are used to represent the relationships between words in a corpus. The term-document matrix, where rows represent words and columns represent documents, is a prime example. This matrix helps in various NLP tasks, including document clustering and topic modeling.</p>

    <h2>Linear Transformation and Feature Extraction:</h2>
    <p>Linear transformations are essential in feature engineering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that uses linear algebra to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its variance. PCA identifies orthogonal vectors (principal components) that capture the most significant variability in the data. These components are essentially linear transformations of the original features. PCA has applications in image compression, face recognition, and data visualization.</p>

    <h2>Dot Products for Similarity and Distance Metrics:</h2>
    <p>The dot product of vectors is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that finds extensive use in machine learning. For instance, the dot product is central to cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. In information retrieval systems, cosine similarity is employed to assess the similarity between a query and a document. The closer the angle between the vectors, the more similar they are.</p>

    <h2>Matrix Multiplication in Neural Networks:</h2>
    <p>Matrix multiplication is at the heart of neural network operations. Each layer of a neural network can be represented as a matrix transformation. During forward propagation, input data is multiplied by weight matrices, and activation functions are applied. Backpropagation, which is used for training neural networks, computes gradients through matrix differentiations. This process is vital for updating weights and minimizing the loss function.</p>

    <h2>Real-world Example: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</h2>
    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use linear algebra extensively in image classification tasks. A CNN processes an input image by applying convolution operations, which are essentially matrix multiplications. Filters or kernels slide across the image, and the dot product between the filter and a local region of the image is computed at each step. This process allows the network to learn features hierarchically, starting from edges and gradually moving to more complex structures. The final layers of the network use matrix operations for classification.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Linear algebra is a foundational tool in machine learning, enabling the efficient representation, transformation, and analysis of data. Concepts like matrices and dot products are instrumental in various machine learning algorithms, from dimensionality reduction to neural network training. Understanding linear algebra is crucial for machine learning practitioners to develop and optimize models effectively. Its applications are pervasive in the field, contributing to advancements in image processing, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, and more.</p>
